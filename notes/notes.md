I'm a little blocked on this project right now. I want to be able to select a node, and then automatically find a place in the subtree where I can add given node type.

I might be able to do this by somehow parsing the tree sitter JSON format. It looks like grammars are written in JS, then converted to JSON.. so that might work.
